# cisaCatalogBot

## Synposis
I tweet every time Cisa updates their [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog) 

## Description
I wanted to know when Cisa updates their Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog to quickly learn what vulnerabilites attackers are targetting, thus cisaCatalogBot was born.

cisaCatalogBot will check the catalog every 6 hours for updates to the catalog. For every new vulnerability added to the catalog, cisaCatalogBot will tweet it.
